# surfs_up
Software: vscode jupyter notebook.
##Overview
This analysis focuses on the weather temperature for opening a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii, by using jupyter notebook and vscode we can find the outcomes for the months June and December
##Results
June: The highest temp in June was 85 and the lowest was 64, the average temp was 75
Dec: The highest temp in December was 83 and the lowest was 56, the average temp was  71
Differences: In December the temps. are lower but don’t break 40 degrees, the average temp is lower and most the time it was 71 degrees. In June we see higher temperatures and higher lows.
Similarities: Both average 77 and 74 degrees 75% of the time. There averages are also 74 and 71 degrees. Both months never see freezing weather or high heat.
##Summary
Between the two months Hawaii’s weather barely fluctuates over 15 degrees. We can see that with a low of 56 that a surf and ice cream shop wouldn’t be effected by weather, along with the rest of the year his idea would be ideal. To further this investigation, we could add more data like months, rainfall, tsunami weather. And to broaden our search we could start another project to see if pop up shops are future proof(by percentage) in Hawaii.
